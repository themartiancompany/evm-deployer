# EVM Deployer

Solidity smart contracts deployer for Ethereum
Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible blockchain networks.

```bash
man \
  evm-deployer
```

It tightly integrates with
[EVM Wallet](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-wallet),
and uses
[Solidity compiler](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/solidity-compiler)
to compile contracts,
[EVM Chains Info](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-chains-info)
to retrieve informations about the blockchain networks and
[Ethers](
  https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers)
to deploy contracts.

This program is part of the EVM Toolchain.

## Installation

The program in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

The program has officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`evm-deployer`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  evm-deployer
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
program is hosted on
[evm-deployer-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evm-deployer-ur).
Be aware the mirror could go offline any time as Github and more
in general all HTTP resources are inherently unstable and censorable.
